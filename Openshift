It integrates multiple tools and technologies for flawless execution of CI/CD pipelines.
RHOCP can do almost everything from code management to build, test and deployment - RHOCP can do it all!


Is RHOCP the future - can it replace tools like Jenkins?

RHOCP is a strong contender to Jenkins when it comes to container platform however, RHOCP has severe limitations in cloud or virtualization world.


Architecture of RHOCP

RHOCP is positioned as a container management platform where it provides the abstraction layer for smooth communication between the user and the containers.
Behind the scenes, RHOCP manages Podman - a daemon-less platform which provides resilience, speed and security.
Its container communicate directly with runtime-C (runc module) which makes it faster than docker.
